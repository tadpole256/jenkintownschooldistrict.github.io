# The Jenkintown School District UNOFFICIAL Archive
This is a repository of public information, policies, and communications about and from the School District of Jenkintown in Pennsylvania. This is an UNOFFICIAL Archive, created as a public service for anyone interested.

This respository was created by a single member of the community, but community participation, and crowd-sourcing is welcome.

This page is hosted on GitHub, and it is intended to serve as a public resource. **This site is in no way affiliated with the actual School District of Jenkintown.**

Our local school district makes a wide variety of resources available online on their website. However, they sometimes remove or update resources without public notice.

The sudden removal of announcements, policies, meeting notes, etc. can sometimes be problematic for members of the community. This is a community lead project to try to save a historical archive of as much of these documents as possible.

This site is currently a crude early-release. I will strive to update it and improve it as time and resources permit. Community input and crowd sourcing of documents is welcome and encouraged.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:jsdcomments@nordalai.com) and let me know what information YOU would find useful to have stored here, and have access to. If you have additional materials/info not yet available here, please feel free to send it to me.
